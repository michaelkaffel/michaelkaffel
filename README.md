My name is Michael Kaffel and I began coding in 2025.

I am still learning and growing as a coder so currently my repositories are mainly practice and exercises.

Please take a moment to explore my <a href="https://web-dev-fundamentals-mk25.web.app/" target="_blank">first</a> and <a href="https://javascript-fundamentals-mk-25.web.app/" target="_blank">second</a> websites after I began my formal education in <a href="https://www.nucamp.co/" target="_blank" >Nucamp's</a> Full Stack Web Dev & Mobile Development.
